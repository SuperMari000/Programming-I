Manchester United was the second highest-earning football club in the world for 2013–14, with an annual revenue of €518 million,[7][8] and the world's third most valuable football club in 2015, valued at $1.98 billion.[9] As of June 2015, it is the world's most valuable football brand, estimated to be worth $1.2 billion.[10][11] It is one of the most widely supported football teams in the world.[12][13] After being floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1991, the club was purchased by Malcolm Glazer in May 2005 in a deal valuing the club at almost £800 million, after which the company was taken private again.
